### ‚úÖ Ensuring folder is in PATH
```python
from pathtub import ensure
folder_to_add = r'C:\something to add to path\folder'
# 1) Check Process PATH
# 2) Add to Process PATH if not found
# 3) Add also to User PATH (permanent), if 2) happens
ensure(folder_to_add, permanent=True)
```
#### What is ensure()?
`ensure(folder)`  checks if `folder` is in Process PATH<br>
- If `folder` is in Process PATH, does nothing
- If `folder` is not in Process PATH, adds it to Process PATH
- If `folder` is not in Process PATH **and** `permanent=True`, adds *also* to the User PATH or System PATH, depending on the `permanent_mode`. 
  
‚ö†Ô∏è If you want to ensure a *DLL folder* is visible to python, use `ensure_dll` instead. 


### üîó **Ensuring** that DLL(s) are found 
```python
from pathtub import ensure_dll
dll_folder = r'C:\path to\libusb-1.0.21\MS32\dll'
ensure_dll(dll_folder)
```
- `ensure_dll()` is for making sure that python finds needed DLL's (and the DLL's find their dependencies, if any.)
- You may use `ensure_dll` and `forget_dll` for adding and removing dll folder to/from search path.
- See also: [Example of using ensure_dll and forget_dll](docs/dll_paths.md)




### üßΩ Cleaning PATH
```python
from pathtub import clean
# Default parameter values shown
clean(sort=True, remove_non_existent=True, remove_user_duplicates=True)
```
### What does it do
- Removes duplicates and empty entries (`;;`) from the "User PATH" and "System PATH" (trailing backslash neglected when comparing two folders). Editing "System PATH" needs that python is executed with Admin rights.
- Sorts PATH(s) alphabetically (optional, enabled by default). Controlled with the `sort` parameter.
- Removes folders from PATH(s) that do not exist on the filesystem (optional, enabled by default). Controlled with the `remove_non_existent` -parameter.
- Removing from "User PATH" the entries that are in the "System PATH" (optional, enabled by default). Controlled with the `remove_user_duplicates`-parameter.

- Full documentation of `clean()` is in the source code ([pathtools.py](pathtub/pathtools.py)).
